## Title
### Task List (Traditional Approach)



## DESCRIPTION
This is task list created with pure traditional vanilla javascript coding without any ecma standarads applied 

## Structure

### This webpage structure is made-up-of 3 files
##### 1) html file
##### 2) style.css
##### 3) index.js file

1) The index.html file consists of table-based-skeleton-structure and is bootstrap based. The table-head holds the task-creation phase, whereas the table-body contains the created tasks' list.
2) The major part of html skeleton is dressed with the help of Bootstrap, however some minor fine tunnings(related to colours,typography etc.etc accross various devices ) are achieved with the help of css.  
3) The js file manages the whole functionality of this site. The script is mainly responsible for 
a) Form-Handling
b) Handling attached Events 
c) Accessing and Manipulating DOM.

I must say that the code in index.js file is clean and little bit organized but not reusable due to fact that I made it so.
